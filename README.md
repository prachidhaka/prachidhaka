## Hi there 👋

 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science ...

I'm passionate about **data analysis** and diving into the exciting world of **data science**. 
Here's what you'll find in my repositories:

### 📊 Data Analysis Projects

-Project 1: Data Analysis and Visualization :

Insights:
-Analyzed traffic and behavior data to identify top-performing content categories—Animals (21.4%) and Science (20.3%)—and developed a data-driven content strategy.

-Performed audience analysis to identify the highest user engagement in May (2,138) and optimized future campaign scheduling accordingly.

-Classified content into 16 distinct categories to increase content library diversity and improve user experience.

-Analyzed user engagements (1,897 reactions on Animal content) to personalize content and increase audience engagement.

## Hi there 👋


**Prachi** 


 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science ...

I'm passionate about **data analysis** and diving into the exciting world of **data science**.
**A collection of data analysis and visualization projects using Excel, Power BI, Python, and SQL. These projects showcase my skills in data manipulation, analysis, and dashboard creation.**
 
Here's what you'll find in my repositories:

### 📊 Data Analysis Projects
**Welcome to my data analysis and visualization projects repository! Here, you will find a collection of projects that showcase my skills in Excel, Power BI, Python, and SQL. Each project includes detailed descriptions, visualizations, and insights.**

-Project 1: Data Analysis and Visualization :
##In this project, I performed :

-Analyzed traffic and behavior data to identify top-performing content categories—Animals (21.4%) and Science (20.3%)—and developed a data-driven content strategy.

-Performed audience analysis to identify the highest user engagement in May (2,138) and optimized future campaign scheduling accordingly.

-Classified content into 16 distinct categories to increase content library diversity and improve user experience.

-Analyzed user engagements (1,897 reactions on Animal content) to personalize content and increase audience engagement.
